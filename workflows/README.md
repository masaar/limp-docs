# LIMP Workflows

In LIMP eco-system, a Workflow is sequence of functionalities coming together to bring a feature. We have decided to go with such categorisation in order to distinguish different set of sequences and internally be able to specify which is doing what at any given time.

This section of the docs contains the technical specs of every Workflow in LIMP in order to:
1. Preserve a good copy of documentation of every Workflow for future updates.
2. Allow developers who would like to contribute to LIMP understand how it internally works.
3. Provide LIMP apps developers with technical details on why is LIMP behaving specifically in event an unexpected behaviour is not documented.
